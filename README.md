This is my second project in python, where I leveraged the PyQt5 library to build a screen recorder in Python.
Below, I have attached a video where I show how my program runs. I can select either full screen or select a certin area of the screen to record. 
If we select fullscreen button before hitting the record button, the screen recorder will automatically cover the entire screen to record.
And if we do not, then it gives us an option to select our desired area of screen that we want to record.
